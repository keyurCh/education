            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term.
                There is disagreement in the academic literature on whether education is an evaluativeconcept. So-called thick definitions affirm this, for example, by holding that animprovement of the learner is a necessary requirement of education. However, differentthick definitions may still disagree among themselves on what constitutes such animprovement. Thin definitions, on the other hand, try to give a value-neutral account ofeducation. A closely related distinction is that between descriptive andprescriptive conceptions. Descriptive conceptions aim to describe how the term isactually used by regular speakers while prescriptive conceptions try to express whatgood education is or how it should be done

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Formal education plays a central role in modern civilization. But in primitive cultures, most of the education happens not on the formal but on the informal level.This usually means that there is no distinction between activities focused on education and other activities. Instead, the whole environment may be seen as a form of school and many or all adults may act as teachers. An important reason for moving to formal forms of education is due to the sheer quantity of knowledge to be passed on, which requires both a formal setting and well-trained teachers to be transmitted effectively.

A sideeffect of the process of formalization is that the educational experience becomes moreabstract and more removed from daily life. In this regard, more emphasis is put ongrasping general patterns instead of observing and imitating particular behavior

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Some researchers, like R. S. Peters, have proposed precise definitions by spelling out the necessary and sufficient conditions of education, for example:it is concerned with the transmission of knowledge and understanding;this transmission is worthwhile and  done in a morally appropriate manner in tune with the student's interests. This and similar attempts are often successful at characterizing the most paradigmatic forms of education but have received numerous criticisms nonetheless, usually in the form of specific counterexamples for which the proposed criteria fail.These difficulties have led various theorists to develop less precise conceptions based on family resemblance. This means that all the different forms of education are similar to each other even though they need not share an essential set of features characteristic of all of them</p>
